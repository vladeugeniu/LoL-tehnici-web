							<p> Faker is renowned for his high mechanical skill at the game and is considered by many to be the best League of Legends player of all time. He is consistently ranked number one by analysts and is often referred to as the "God" of League of Legends. He is one of only two players, along with teammate Bengi, to have won the League of Legends World Championship twice, having done so in the 2013 and 2015 Seasons. He has also won the Mid-Season Invitational tournament in 2016, placing second in 2015</p>

							<p> For the 2016 season, Cloud9 added two new players - Rush and Bunny FuFuu - and moved Hai to support, with the intention of splitting time with Bunny. However, after two losses with Bunny and two wins with Hai in the spring split, they committed to starting Hai full time and rose to a 67% winrate, with a third-place seed in the playoffs. However, despite a seeding advantage, the team lost to TSM in the first round and were eliminated. Sneaky ended up losing the Worlds Quarterfinals with Cloud 9 against Samsung Galaxy 30 minutes ago</p>

							<p> In September 2010 he began playing League, his arrival into the game being later than many of his peers and team mates who in most cases had been playing since beta. The first champion he played was Blitzcrank, who he continues to play on a competitive level. He regards the decision to play Blitzcrank as one of the factors which made the game fun for him</p>

							<p> RNG dominated the group stage at MSI, only losing a game to Counter Logic Gaming and then SK Telecom T1. With an 8-2 record, RNG finished the group in 1st place. Despite their amazing performance in groups, they were defeated 1-3 by SKT in the Semifinals, earning a respectable 3rd-4th place finish at the event.</p>
